# PostHog Funnel Setup Guide - DeepTrack Gotham

## üéØ Overview
This guide shows you how to create and analyze funnels in PostHog based on the events we've implemented in your DeepTrack Gotham application.

## üìä Key Funnels to Create

### 1. **Main Conversion Funnel** (Most Important)
**Purpose**: Track users from file upload to successful payment

**Steps**:
1. `file_upload_started` - User begins uploading files
2. `file_upload_completed` - Files successfully uploaded
3. `checkout_started` - User initiates payment process
4. `payment_method_selected` - User chooses payment method
5. `purchase` - Payment completed (server-side webhook)
6. `results_viewed` - User views verification results

**PostHog Setup**:
- Go to **Insights** ‚Üí **Funnels**
- Add each event as a step
- Set conversion window: 1 hour
- Group by: `user_type` (authenticated vs anonymous)

### 2. **Authentication Funnel**
**Purpose**: Track user sign-up and sign-in success rates

**Steps**:
1. `user_signed_up` - User creates account
2. `user_signed_in` - User logs in successfully
3. `file_upload_started` - User starts using the service

**PostHog Setup**:
- Conversion window: 24 hours
- Group by: `signup_method` (email vs google)
- Filter by: `page_type: 'signup'` or `page_type: 'login'`

### 3. **Payment Method Funnel**
**Purpose**: Compare token vs card payment conversion

**Steps**:
1. `payment_method_selected` - User chooses payment method
2. `checkout_started` - Payment process begins
3. `purchase` - Payment successful

**PostHog Setup**:
- Group by: `payment_method` (tokens vs paystack)
- Conversion window: 30 minutes
- Add breakdown: `user_type`

### 4. **File Upload Success Funnel**
**Purpose**: Track file upload completion rates

**Steps**:
1. `file_upload_started` - Upload begins
2. `file_upload_completed` - Upload succeeds
3. `checkout_started` - User proceeds to payment

**PostHog Setup**:
- Conversion window: 10 minutes
- Group by: `file_count` (single vs multiple files)
- Filter by: `user_type`

## üîç Advanced Analysis

### Cohort Analysis
- **Retention**: Users who return after first purchase
- **Revenue**: Repeat purchase behavior
- **Engagement**: File upload frequency

### A/B Testing Setup
- **Payment Methods**: Test token vs card preference
- **Upload Flow**: Test different upload interfaces
- **Pricing**: Test different token packages

### Custom Events for Deeper Insights
Consider adding these events for better funnel analysis:

```javascript
// Add to your components
posthog.capture('funnel_step_completed', {
  funnel_name: 'main_conversion',
  step_number: 1,
  step_name: 'file_upload_started',
  user_type: 'authenticated',
  file_count: selectedFiles.length
});
```
